        <h2>My First Flight</h2>
        <p>Flying in a plane for the first time sounds exciting and it was. Frankfurt, Germany was my first plane stop, from there I would board another plane that would take me to Budapest, Hungary, and finally to my last plane stop in Romania. This was the first time my siblings and I flew on an airplane and it was fascinating because every seat had a mini T.V.  behind them and the food was delivered right to our seats. This was a different but exciting experience because we could watch movies whenever we wanted, we got to order whatever food we desired, and sitting next to old people came with a major perk. My siblings and I got always got seats next to older people, and it was fine with us because every time the flight attendants passed out candy the old people would give us theirs. As kids candy was our most prized possession so we were eager to receive candy from anyone who would offer us some.</p>

        <h2>My First Summer Vacation at Florida</h2>
        <p>I had never been on an airplane. My stomach felt like I had just eaten rotten fish and I was about to throw up. I was so excited to go, but at the same time I was scared because I had never been on a plane. We waited in the airport for at least an hour. Finally our flight was called, as I walked on the plane my heart was about to jump out of my skin. After the flight attendant had went through all the rules and we put our seat belts on the plane was going to take off. I thought the worst thing about the flight was taking off and landing. I didn?t like taking off and landing because my ears popped. Other than the fact that my ears popped taking off and landing the flight went smooth, we didn?t crash. When the plane landed, I couldn?t wait to stand on solid ground again.</p>

        <h2>My First Train Journey</h2>
        <p>I experienced my first train journey just last year when my parents took us all to Penang for a holiday. We arrived at the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station at 7.00 a.m. to catch the 7.30 express train to Butterworth. Crowds had started gathering at the ticketing counter to buy tickets and there were long queues. Fortunately, we had bought our tickets two days earlier, so we went straight to the platform. There, we waited for the train and saw many people rushing to the platform. Children were running about happily. We quickly bought some magazines, mints and chocolates.The train finally arrived and we scrambled into our coach to get to our seats. I was lucky to get a good seat near the window. At last, the guard blew the whistle and the train moved slowly and pulled out of the station. I felt thrilled at that very moment and I enjoyed the jerky movement and the new experience.</p>

        <h3>My Journey Experience1</h3>
        <p>One of my passions is travelling. Travel involves visiting new places and meeting new people and having varied experiences. I come originally from Romania and have travelled to UK and US. I remember the quote by Samuel Johnson: “All travel has its advantages. If the passenger visits better countries, he may learn to improve his own. And if fortune carries him to worse, he may learn to enjoy it”. I have had the luck of visiting better countries and I believe my travel experiences have taught me a lot about human life and helped me expand the way I see things.</p>
